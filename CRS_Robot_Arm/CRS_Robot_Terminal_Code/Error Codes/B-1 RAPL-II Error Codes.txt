B-1 RAPL-II Error Codes
All robot operations are monitored for error conditions. Detectable errors are listed in this
appendix. When an error concition exists, a message will be displayed at the default device,
and the ready-light on the teach pendant will turn off.
To clear the error condition, any correct command may be entered. The command will clear
the error detection flag, and will then turn the ready-light back on. A STATUS command will
list the previous error condition.
ERROR MESSAGE CESCRIPTION
000AXIS#1 OUT AXIS #1 IS OUT OF RANGE:
This error means that there has been a Loss Of FeedBack error for joint 1. This error
could be due to a collision with a stationary object, a blown fuse in the motor circuit,
or a true loss of feedhack signal from the encoder.
001 AXIS#2 OUT AXIS #2 IS OUT OF RANGE:
Same as error 000, but for axis 2.

ERROR MESSAGE DESCRIPTION
009EOL NOT FO END OF LINE NOT FOUND:
The end of line descriptor (a <cr>) was not found, causing an incorrect read of the data.
Command lines are limited to 128 characters in length including the EOL character.
010SYMB UNDEF SYMBOL UNDEFINED:
A necessary variable was not present in the symbol table. To correct, manually, or
through the program logic, create a symbol in the table.
011LOCN UNDEF LOCATION UNDEFINED:
The robot location referenced was not previously defined. Check the location table for
the location in questicn, and create if necessary.
012COMM ERR?? COMMAND ERROR:
The command entered was not found in the command list. A spelling mistake, or the lack
of a space between th: line number and the command descriptor could have caused this
problem. Either re-type the line, or inspect the program line for the mistake.
013 ARG MISSIN ARGUMENT MISSING:
An argument was expected, but not read. Check the command syntax
014 BAD SYNTAX BAD SYNTAX:
A general error which occurs when the command line could not be decoded. Check for a
spelling error in the command name.
015PP NOT LEG PRECISION POINT NOT LEGAL:
A precision point was specified as a location in the command line, but was not permitted
in this situation.
016I/0 ADDR?? I/0 ADDRESS ERROR:
The I/0 number which was entered in the command line was beyond the permissable range.
Standard digital I/0 is from 1 to 16, while optionally, 1 to 40 can be used.
017PROG NOT F PROGRAM NOT FOUND:
The program called was not found in the program directory. Create the program, or check
the spelling of the missing program call command.
018ILLEG ARGU ILLEGAL ARGUMENT:
An argument was entered, but not permitted.
O19LINE NOT F LINE NOT FOUND:
The program line number called in a branching statement is not present in the program.
020ARG TOO BI ARGUMENT TOO BIG:
The value of a specified argument is too big for the command.
APPENDIX B - 2
B-1 RAPL-II Error Codes (continued)
ERROR MESSAGE DESCRIPTION
021NO ROOM LE NO ROOM LEFT:
The program buffer is full, and cannot accept any further information. Delete unwanted
programs, or re-allocate memory with the ALLOCATE command.
022TABLE FULL TABLE FULL:
The robot controller maintains program names, location and variable references in tables.
This error means that there is no room left to store a new item. Delete all unwanted
information, or re-allocate memory.
023BAD LINE N BAD LINE NUMBER: -
The line number called could not be found, and that a value of zerc was returned after
its search. The value of zero is an illegal line number.
024ILL A/D CH {LLEGAL A/D CHANNEL:
An illegal analog to digital conversion channel was specified. Channel numbers 1 to 25
are valid. Channel 9 is the speed selector knob on the teach pendant.
025LINE TOO L LINE TOO LONG:
The command line exceeded the maximum number of characters permitted, 128 characters.
026 EOF NOT FO END OF FILE NOT FOUND:
An end-of-file character was not found. This implies that a program buffer error has
occurred. To remedy clear all memory and re-load all information. If the problem
persists, then a fault exists in user memory, or a problem with storing the information
on an external device caused invalid storage of information. When this information was
re-loaded, the EOF character was not found, thus causing the error.
027PROG EXIST PROGRAM EXISTS:
An attempt to create a duplicate file name, or an attempt to load into an existing file
name was discovered. Either delete the existing file, or define a new program name for
the new function.
028 LINE EXIST LINE EXISTS:
An attempt to insert an existing line number was found. Either define a new line number,
or delete the old one first.
029 XFRM ILLEG TRANSFORM ILLEGAL
A move to an imposisible robot coordinate was attempted and the coordinate
transformation for the location generated a mathematically impossible result.

ERROR MESSAGE DESCRIPTION
032HOME FAIL1 JOINT #1 HOME FAILURE:
The home sequence failed during the motion of axis 1. The axis was commanded a motion
of just over 1000 pulses, or one motor revolution. During this motion, a zero-crossing
marker pulse was expected but not seen. This could be due to an encoder failure, a
wiring problem or just 3 lack of power to motor 1. Check for servo action and retry the
HOME command. If it fails again, check encoder function and connection.
033 HOME FAIL2 JOINT #2 HOME FAILURE:
Follow the same procecure as error 032.
034 HOME FAIL3 JOINT #3 HOME FAILURE:
Follow the same procecdure as error 032.

038 HOME FATL7 TNYNT 27 HOME FATT.URE:
Follow the same procedure as error 032.
039 HOME FAILS JOINT #8 HOME FAILURE:
Follow the same procedure as error 032.
040ARM POWER ARM POWER:
The arm power switch was turned off, which means that no power is going to the servo
motors. In this condit:on, the robot cannot move. The robot has been placed in a LIMP
state.
041 NOT HOMED NOT HOMED:
The robot cannot perform the requested motion because it has not been homed after power
up.
042JNT #1 OUT JOINT #1 OUT OF RANGE:
The next motion will send joint 1 out of range. Inspect the destination point for
validity.
043 JNT #2 OUT JOINT #2 OUT OF RANGE:
Follow the same procedure as error 042.
044 JNT #3 OUT JOINT #3 OUT OF RANGE:
Follow the same procedure as error 042.

046 JNT #5 OUT JOINT #5 OUT OF RANGE:
Follow the same procedure as error 042.
047 CHECKSUM F CHECKSUM FAILURE:
The desired item of memory (program, location or variable) has been changed in some
unpredictable way. The use of this memory item could cause unexpected results. Check
the item and change or edit it to the correct value. -
048 RESERVED
049MEM NOT AL MEMORY NOT ALLOCATED:
RAPL-II checked user memory and believes it has not been allocated. This could be an
indication of battery failure. Use the ALLOC command to partition and clear the robot
memory before use.
0S0AMBIG CMD AMBIGUOUS COMMAND:
The user specified too few characters in a command specifier so that it is not yet a
unique command choice. Re-enter the command. This error will occur when pressing a <cr>
immediately after the prompt.
051#0 TXD TIM SERIAL CHANNEL #0 TIMEOUT:
A timeout in serial device 0 indicating a hardware communication failure. When you see
this message, the concition should already be cleared, but check the cable and its
connections to be safe. If this fails, then turn system off and on.
052#0 CTS TIM SERIAL CHANNEL #0 CTS TIMEOUT:
A timeout in the serial device 0 handshake control signal. This will appear only if the
operator has selected a CTS/RTS handshake format. A timeout error would seem to
indicate that the external device has failed, or a connection has come loose.
053#1 TXD TIM SERIAL CHANNEL #1 TIMEOUT:
Follow the same procecure as error 051 but for device 1.
052#1 CTS TIM SERIAL CHANNEL #1 CTS TIMEOUT:

trying to RUN a subroutine), or a attempted GOSUB call would result in a subroutine
nesting level greater than 10,

An extra axis commanc was issued to a nonexistent axis. Use the @NOA command to set
the number of axes.
064NOT AVAIL NOT AVAILABLE
An option cannot be installed in the current system, or a function has been rendered
unavailable with the current software.
065SLOT USED AXIS SLOT ALREADY USED
Either the programmer was attempting to set up the controller for 8 axes while the servo
or magnetic gripper cption was installed, or vice versa. The programmer must deactivate
the option which uses slot 8 first before assigning the new function.
066 STR ERROR STRAIGHT LINE ERROR
A straight line path was halted since it hit a joint limit. It may not be possible to move
the arm out of this josition using a straight line, so use a JOINT move.
067NOT INSTAL EXPANSION MEMORY NOT INSTALLED
The continuous path command CTPATH was attempted, but the extra memory option was not
installed. Could also indicate an attempt to write to a write-protected or missing EEPROM
memory board.
